The idea here was to emulate Blizzard's Overwatch's Hanzo's bow and arrow mechanic in Unity. To do this I used Unity's rigidbody physics engine along with some of my own scripts.
The doc I linked is a write-up I did about it that goes in depth. Unfortunately, I don't have any more pictures at the moment as I recently lost it along with my computer when it broke.
