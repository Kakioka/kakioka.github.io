The idea for the game was to utilize the XR Foundation package in Unity in order to create a mobile AR game. Focusing specifically on the ability to place and anchor objects in AR in real world space and NOT relative to the camera. 
At the moment, the player will open the app and be greeted with a start screen as per usual. The player can place up to five plants that they then must juggle by selecting and watering each plant within a certain time limit. 
Should the player fail to water said plant within the time limit, it dies. There is no scoring system yet but I am planning on adding one. When the player successfully manages to maintain a plant for the alloted time the plant will grow. This then repeats infinitely for now. 
I plan to add a monetary system that rewards the player for growing plants to a certain size, then adding in a shop where the player can spend their money on other plants. Maybe even new pots for said plants. 
Here is a video of the current prototype on Youtube, https://youtu.be/Mrgtm27IQOs
