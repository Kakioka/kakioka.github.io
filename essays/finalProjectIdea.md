## Overview
*The problem:* Kayak and sites like it tout false information on cheap flights from Hawaii. From everywhere really, but Hawaii is what pertains to me. They get their data, not only from legitimate airline companies but also from illegitimate ones, like edreams. 
*The solution:* An app that collects data from only the legitimate airlines and arranges it in a neat and easy to use way. Although, the user won't be able to book a flight directly from the app, it will still (hopefully) be of use. 
## Mockup Page Ideas
The main feature would be a destination search bar in the navbar and a calendar with prices and airlines taking center stage. The navbar would also feature a login/sign up icon and dropdown menu. 
## Use Case Ideas
 - User creates account
 - User selects destination
 - User views prices at different dates from different airlines
 - User goes to those airlines' actual sites for more information
## Beyond the Basics
It would be cool if a user could be notified whenever the price on a destination dropped below a certain point. It also might be interesting to try to incorporate the links to each sites' price listing for each date on the calendar.
