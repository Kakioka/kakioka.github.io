I have always loved games. Video games especially. I also took a liking to programming in high school. Thus, when choosing a career, the natural choice was game design/creation.
I delved into the topic, learning about different game engines, and the languages used to program in them. I also learned about the different skills I would need to back up my desire to be a game developer. 
This lead me to software engineering. A major part of game design is the design of the systems that run in the background. Whether it be a health system or a damage one, many different systems require clever and efficient software engineering techniques to maintain the speed and efficacy with which the game runs.
In the future I hope to learn as much as I can in regards to all facets of programming and computer science, if only to be the best programmer I can be.

Of further interest to me would be learning many different languages that compliment each other, perhaps even becoming skilled enough to become a so called full-stack developer. 
Beyond these personal skills I would like to acquire, I put great stake on experience. While I do program on my own, I would love to be a part of a game design effort and learn what it's like to program and develop in a team.
I have made a number of games on my own, though they are only prototypes, so working in a team would be a new and educational experience for me. 
To surmise, I hope to glean as much as I can from all those around me. I am interested in the subject matter, and excited to learn more.
