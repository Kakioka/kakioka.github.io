# I Hate Web Design
When you think of good web design, what do you think of? Google during the browser wars took the lead based on their website design being clean, and easy to use. It was simply their logo, a search bar, and white space all around. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have websites like [this](https://woodwork.nl). Complex, beautiful, and it took forever to load. What exactly does this add to the website? More importantly, perhaps, how does it help the user get what they want from said website? 

## What I Like
I won't lie, part of the reason I really dislike web design is that I'm not very good at it. I just don't really get it. To me, the ideal website looks something like [this](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com) (content warning on this one, lots of profanity).  It's clean, simple, and loads very quickly. Above all, it gets the point across effectively. I mean, that's what it's all about right? Communication? 

## What We Like
This brings me to Semantic UI. A UI framework that I actually like. Using HTML and CSS was tedius and painful. With Semantic UI, I can simply use English like I normally would and voila! CSS and HTML successfully avoided. Not completely of course, but to a certain degree. No more hours spent laying everything out *juuuust* right, with Semantic UI's easy-to-use grid system, layouts are a breeze! So let's not get hung up on semantics, and get started with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com), for free of course.

### By The Way
Semantic UI's website (linked above) is made using Semantic UI. Here's a [list](https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Semantic-UI) of other websites if you're interested.
